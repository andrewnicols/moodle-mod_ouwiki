<p>
Creating wiki pages can be confusing if you aren\'t familiar with wikis.
</p>
<ul>
<li>A key principle is that pages on a wiki should be <strong>linked together</strong> in some way.</li>
<li>In order to ensure this happens, you have to create a <strong>link to the new page</strong> before you can create the new page itself.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wiki links</h3>
<p>
When editing a page, links are created by typing the title of a page you want to link to inside double square brackets.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to link to a page titled <strong>Fish</strong>, you would type <strong>[[Fish]]</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>New pages</h3>
<p>
To create a new page:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Think of a <strong>title</strong> for your page. The title should be different to the titles of other pages on the wiki.
It should describe the content of your page.
An example title might be <strong>Frogs and other amphibians</strong>.</li>
<li>Decide which page should <strong>link</strong> to your new page. If the wiki is small this might be the
start page. Otherwise, find an appropriate page.</li>
<li><strong>Edit</strong> the page that will contain the link.</li>
<li>Find the point where you would like the link to go, and type it in: <strong>[[Frogs and other amphibians]]</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Save</strong> this change. The link you have created should appear, ready for use.</li>
<li><strong>Click</strong> the link. You will be asked whether you want to create a new page.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Yes</strong>. The edit window appears for your new page.</li>
<li><strong>Type in</strong> the initial text of your page, then <strong>save</strong> it. Your page is now created.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Hints</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you\'re creating multiple pages, you might want to make all the links in one go.</li>
<li>You can make links to new pages even when you personally don\'t intend to create the new page.
When you do that, the "missing" pages are indicated in the wiki index view. This could be used
to indicate that you think the page should exist.</li>
<li>Be careful about titles - once a page has been created, the title can\'t be changed.</li>
</ul>';

A wiki is a web-based system that lets users edit a set of linked pages. In Moodle, you would normally

This wiki behaves as one single wiki. Everybody on the course sees the same pages.</li>

Members of each group see an entirely separate copy of the wiki (sub-wiki) specific to their
group. You can only see pages created by people in the same group. If you are in
more than one group, or you have permissions that allow you to view all groups,
you get a dropdown to choose a group.</li>
<li><strong>Separate wiki for every user</strong><br />
Every single user gets an entirely different wiki. You can only see your own wiki unless
you have permissions that allow you to view others, when you get a dropdown to choose
a user. (This can be used as a way for students to contribute work, although you should
consider other ways to achieve this such as the Assessment activity.)</li>

$string['summary_help'] = '

Summaries are entirely optional and your wiki may not need one. If you don\'t need a
summary, just leave the box blank.
</p>';
$string['template_help'] = '
<p>
A template is a predefined set of wiki pages. When a template is set, the wiki starts off
with the content defined in the template.
</p>

<p>
The template applies to each subwiki; in "One wiki per group" mode, for example, each
group\'s wiki is initialised with the pages in the template.
</p>

<p>
To create a template, write the pages you want on any wiki, then visit the Index page and
click the "Save wiki as template" button. (You can also manually create templates in other
software; it is an extremely simple XML format. Look at a saved template to see the format.)
</p>

<p>
You cannot change the template after the wiki has been created. If you want to do this,
delete the wiki entirely, then create a new one using the template.
</p>';
$string['timeout_help'] = '
<p>
If you select a timeout, people editing the wiki are only allowed to edit it for a given time.
The wiki locks pages while they are being edited (so that two people can\'t edit the same page
at once), so setting a timeout prevents the wiki becoming locked for others.
</p>

<h3>What users see</h3>

<p>
When timeout is enabled, users see a countdown when they edit a page. If the countdown reaches
zero, their browser will automatically save any changes and stop editing.
</p>

<h3>Users without Javascript enabled</h3>

<p>
This option has no effect on users who don\'t have Javascript enabled or who have old browsers.
A fifteen-minute timeout always applies to these users. When they edit a page, it displays the time
by which they must save it; if they do not, they might lose their work.
</p>

<h3>Why you might not need this option</h3>

<p>
Even when this option is turned off, locks are automatically discarded in the following situations after
a user has begun to edit a page:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Without saving changes or cancelling, the user moves to a different page.</li>
<li>The user closes their browser.</li>
<li>The user\'s computer crashes.</li>
<li>The user loses their Internet connection.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In these situations the lock is automatically removed after about two minutes.
</p>

<p>
In addition, tutors and course staff have (by default) the ability to override any lock at any time.
</p>

<h3>What this option doesn\'t do</h3>

<p>
This option doesn\'t stop somebody holding on to a page and preventing other users from editing it if
they are very determined. They could edit a page and wait until the timeout is about to expire before
saving changes then very quickly editing it again.
</p>';
